<p>Main Page

    Your recipe book should have a main page with a navigation bar.

    The main page should have a background image that indicates what your site is about, as well as large text that introduces the application, e.g. "My Recipe Book"

    This text should be centred across the page.

    Use a high quality image for the page background:

    Use this site  (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.for guidance.

    Make sure you choose a font colour that you can see over the picture!!

    Navigation bar

    The navigation bar should have the following items:

    - My Recipe Book (the brand for the navigation). Use a Google font for this.

    - List recipes - this should take you to the photo gallery

    - Each of the recipes that are available on the site should have a link in the navigation bar.

    - There should be different recipes from everyone in the class on the site.

    Photo Gallery

    The photo gallery should allow a user to see 2 recipes per row. Each recipe should have an image which is a clickable link to the recipe, and a caption, indicating the name of the recipe.



    Recipes

    Each recipe MUST have the following sections:

    - Navigation bar (this should link to all the other recipes). Bonus points for showing the page on which the current user is.

    - Recipe title

    - Country (the country's flag should be shown on the same line as the name of the country)

    - Ingredients

    - Directions

    - How many people the recipe serves. This should be in a well where available, and in bold text.

    Other sections are optional.

    Use bullet points for ingredients, and make sure your images, and text are correctly aligned.

    Display Images and ingredients side by side as far as possible, and wrap the ingredients around the image where the list of ingredients is too long.

    Done already?

    A user should always be able to tell where they are in your application. Do this by highlighting the 'active' link, as is shown in the bootstrap documentation.

    Don't forget to use Google Fonts (Links to an external site.)!</p>
